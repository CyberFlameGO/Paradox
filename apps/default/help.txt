Hi!

I am Paradøx, a multipurpose bot aimed at helping you manage your server. My prefix is `{prefix}`.
I have a wide variety of useful commands for all of your needs. I have extensive moderation commands with mod logging, multi user support, and hackbanning.
As utility is a main aspect, I have a heap of utility commands such as timezone lookup, showing times for users, a piggybank, and message recalling features (quote, echo, jumpto, notifyme).

I have many informative commands that you can use to obtain user, role, and server information. I can also recall username changes, show avatars and lookup user discriminators! 
Of course, you need some fun commands. I have image grabbing commands (dog, cat, duck), image search, and Lenny. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

If you wish to view the entire list of commands, use `{prefix}list`.
I can be invited at <https://invite.paradoxical.pw> and if you love me, please consider donating to my developers to cover server costs and support future development at <{donate}>.

Need help with Paradøx? Head to our server for support or if you're just looking for a nice chat! <invite>
